This is to the best of my knowledge a minimal boilerplate web-services based on Flask as the backend, and React as the frontend. This is heavily inspired by https://itnext.io/a-template-for-creating-a-full-stack-web-application-with-flask-npm-webpack-and-reactjs-be2294b111bd

This branch uses `react-scripts` to simplify the setup. Instead of explicitly install `webpack` and `babel` transpiler, we install `react-scripts`, which though has many more extra dependencies than installing the former does result in a simpler `package.json`. `react-scripts` also regularizes the dir structure such that the js entry point must be `src/index.js` and the target html must be `public/index.html`. The dev html page DOES NOT need to include js bundle when developing using `react-scripts start`.

The `package.json` scripts are changed accordingly. In particular, we want to develope using `react-scripts start` and build using `webpack`. The `watch` script is the `webpack` version of the development environment. `webpack-cli` has to be installed explicitly to build though `webpack` is already a dependency of `react-scripts`.

To build we can definitely use `react-scripts build` to get real production level code. I personally find the build folder not tidy so I choose to build in my own way, using `webpack-cli`.
